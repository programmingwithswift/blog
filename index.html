        <p>
            This is a simple but annoying fix. In order for you to use canvas with Xcode 11 you will need upgrade your operation system on your Mac. It needs to be running macOS Catalina/macOS 10.15.

        <p>
            Today I will show you how to create custom table view cells and use it in a static table view. A static table view can be useful when creating menu&rsquo;s that do not change or app settings. Pretty much anything that can be listed that will have fixed values.
Custom cells for static table view are done in the exact same way as custom cells for dynamic table views. One needs to register the nib and then use the cellForRowAt method to use the custom cell.

        <p>
            This is can be a frustrating issue. One of the fixes for this is to restart Xcode. There can also be another solution and that is to change the device that you have chosen for deployment.
This issue can also occur if you are trying to run the app on an iPhone but you have set your Device under Deployment info to iPad, or vice versa.

        <img src="" />
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            What is a completion handler A completion handler is basically just a function that gets passed as a parameter of another function.
The reason that we would want to do this is because we want to be notified when something is complete. Generally we use functions that return a value, but this is only useful when we are doing synchronous work. For asynchronous work we use completion handlers.
A good example of this is when we do a network request.

        <p>
            Today I will show you how to create a singleton with Swift. Singletons are a very touchy subject when it comes to programming. Personally I do not have an issue with them as long as it is used appropriately.
Why use a Singleton The use case for a singleton is relatively small. The very few places where singletons can be used is when they are immutable or when they are one way.

        <p>
            Today I will show you how to fix Type does not conform to protocol 'Decodable'. The fix is not difficult but it can be annoying that one needs to write wrappers for the types that do not conform.
Lets get started. The below code is my broken example.
1 2 3 4 5 6  struct User: Codable { let name: String let email: String let profilePicture: UIImage let location: CLLocationCoordinate2D }   The problem with the above code is that both UIImage and CLLocationCoordinate2D do not conform to Decodable.

        <p>
            I have recently been going through warnings on a project I am working on. One of the warnings was 'Hashable.hashValue' is deprecated as a protocol requirement; conform type to 'Hashable' by implementing 'hash(into:)' instead.
This confused me a bit so I decided to carry on with the other warnings. It turns out this is a really simple fix.
Here is an example of the issue:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16  enum ImageSize: Hashable { case small case medium case large public var hashValue: Int { switch self { case .

            In this tutorial I will show you how to setup Charles with your iPhone. Charles is an extremely useful tool. I have used it often to debug my network calls, or to change the value that the server has returned to ensure that my app is behaving correctly.
Step 1: Get the proxy details The first thing that you need to do once you have Charles open is to navigate to:

        <p>
            Notifications can be daunting, in this post I hope to make it simple by showing you how to send local notification as well as how to handle the user tapping that notification.

Foundational information Local notifications have three main parts. The content, trigger and request. These three parts will allow you to create a local notification.
Content The content of a notification is straight forward. It is what you are going to show the user.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            What are UserDefaults suites UserDefaults contains different suites that are identified by their suiteName. This can allow you to create different UserDefaults for different sections of your app, but it also allows you to share content between multiple apps and extensions that use the same App Group.
 Your suiteName cannot be the same as your apps bundle identifier. Using the global domain is also not allowed as it is not writeable by apps.
