<p>This is an issue that I got recently. I have to be honest, I don’t often write unit tests which is something that I am starting to change, hence me getting stuck with this little issue.</p>

<p>Turns out I was missing something really obvious. I was using the “Generic iOS Device” from the simulator/device drop down list.</p>

<p>In order to fix this issue all one needs to do is to switch to a proper simulator or device and this error will go away.</p>

<p>If you want to see a video tutorial on this I have created one, you can watch it below:</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I hope that this has helped you get over this issue. I was struggling a bit as I didn’t even think of the simulators.</p>
