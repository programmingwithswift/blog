<p>I was setting up rich notifications the other using a library and I was required to create a few extra targets. I followed all the steps correctly but Xcode was not liking what I had done.</p>

<p>Xcode would build successfully but it would prompt me saying that it failed to set plugin placeholders. Personally I had never seen this message before so I started googling, turns out it was a really simple fix.</p>

<p>Before we get to the fix, make sure to clean your build folder as well as delete derived data. I always do this before trying a fix as one never knows what issues these things can cause.</p>

<p>Great, now that you have cleaned your build folder and deleted your derived data we can get started.</p>

<h2 id="step-1">Step 1</h2>

<p>Click on your project in the <code>Project Navigator</code></p>

<h2 id="step-2">Step 2</h2>

<p>Next you will need to select your main target and go to its <code>build phases</code> tab.</p>

<h2 id="step-3">Step 3</h2>

<p>Once you are on the <code>build phases</code> tab you should see a drop down that says <code>Embed App Extensions</code>, click on that. Now that you have opened <code>Embed App Extensions</code> you should see a checkbox that says <code>Copy only when installing</code>. You need to check that checkbox.</p>
